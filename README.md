# DronePrograming
my first take on autonomous drone programming. 

## FaceTracking.py
Automates the drone flight to follow a frontalface using `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`. Able to track and follow when an object (face) is moving towards/backwards from the drone and when a an object is moving left/right from the drone. 

## KeyboardControl.py
Uses the PyGame library to receive input from the keyboard to control the direction and speed of the drone. 
Also uses OpenCV for live-time footage of the drone in flight.
